# SQL_Challenge
Module 9

Received help from tutor, Mark F. and instructor. 

### NOTE TO GRADER: 
Currently having issues when making queries with large outputs. 
When entering query with large output, "Connection to pgAdmin server has been lost" repeatedly. 
Only able to complete query when a LIMIT has been set for certain queries. 
Instructor is aware and am currently working on this issue with instructor. 
LIMIT is only in code due to issue.
