Received help from tutor, Mark F. and instructor. 

Sketch of ERD from https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ 

NOTE TO GRADER: 
Currently having issues when making queries with large outputs. 
When entering query with large output, "Connection to pgAdmin server has been lost" repeatedly. 
Only able to complete query when a LIMIT has been set for certain queries. 
Instructor is aware and am currently working on this issue with instructor. 
Told to put disclaimer for grader that LIMIT is only in code due to issue.
